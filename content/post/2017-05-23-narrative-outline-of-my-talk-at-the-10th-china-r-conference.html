<p>The <a href="http://china-r.org/bj2017/">10th China R Conference</a> was held in Tsinghua University during May 19 - 21. I initialized the session of <em>R in Public Health</em>. Though it was my first time to organize a session, to invite speakers, and to host it, the session was successful. The number of audiences was more than 55 persons and beyond my expectation, and the discussions were enthusiastic. I believe that via my talk more Chinese have know the <a href="http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/">R Epidemics Consortium (RECON)</a> and they may try to use RECON packages to facilitate their epidemics research.</p>
<p>Since materials on RECON of <a href="https://github.com/caijun/talks/blob/master/china-r_2017/china-r_2017.pdf">my slides</a> were partly provided by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/thibautjombart/">Dr. Thibaut Jombart</a>, the founder of RECON, I had sent my slides and narrative outline to Dr. Jombart for reviewing before my talk. The narrative outline of my talk is as follows:</p>
<p>“On May 21, 2017 I will give a talk on <strong>R Epidemics Consortium and Using Its Packages to Analyze Influenza Data</strong> (see slide 1) during the <em>R in Public Health</em> session of the 10th China R conference. The talk consists of four parts (see slide 2).</p>
<p>During the talk, I will firstly introduce the precursor of RECON — Hackout 3 (see slide 3), then RECON (see slides 4 and 5) and its forum (see slide 6). Of course, I will call on audiences to join RECON.</p>
<p>In the second part of RECON packages, I will introduce the aims of RECON packages (see slide 7) and then list all packages that RECON has (see slides 8 and 9), among which I will focus on three packages — <em>outbreaks</em>, <em>incidence</em> and <em>EpiEstim</em> as I will use them to demostrate how to use RECON packages to analyze influenza data in the following parts.</p>
<p>The slides of first two parts mainly refer to Dr. Jombart’s talk - <a href="https://github.com/thibautjombart/talks/tree/master/Webinar_2017">Webinar_2017</a> and I will give thanks to Dr. Jombart during the talk.</p>
<p>In the Epidemic Curve and incidence package part, I will illustrate the concept of Epidemic Curve (see slide 9) and show that the ISOweek-based weekly stacked bar plot is ubiquitous plot in epidemiological reports by such a figure of China Influenza Laboratory Surveillance Information from WHO GISRS (see slide 10). In the following slides 12 - 14, I will demostrate how <strong>tedious</strong> to plot daily, ISOweek-based epidemic curve of influenza A H7N9 in China, 2013 with group of gender. The dataset used for plots is from <em>outbreaks</em> package, which will be firstly introduced in slide 12. Then <em>incidence</em> package will go to the stage (see slide 15) and I will demotrate how <strong>easy</strong> to plot those figures using <em>incidence</em> package and emphasize on the feature of ISOweek support that I contributed to <em>incidence</em> package (see slides 16 - 18).</p>
<p>In the last part of Time-varying Reproduction Number <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> and <em>EpiEstim</em> package, I will first introduce the concept of reproduction number R and its significant implication (see slide 19) and illustrate how it relates to epidemic curve (see slide 20). Then I will introduce <em>EpiEstim</em> package developed by <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.cori">Dr. Anne Cori</a> and the paper behind <em>EpiEstim</em> package (see slide 21). In the last R code demo (see slides 22 and 23), I will use <em>EpiEstim</em> package to estimate the instantaneous reproduction number for laboratory confirmed pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) in Beijing and plot the estimation with holidays overlaying to explore the holidays effect on the transmission of pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1). You will see in the demo <em>incidence</em> package will also be used. By using <em>EpiEstim</em> package to analyze my own pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) in China, I found a <a href="https://github.com/annecori/EpiEstim/issues/4">bug</a> of <em>EpiEstim</em> package and reported it to Dr. Cori. This is why I would like to introduce <em>EpiEstim</em> package during this talk.&quot;</p>
