<p>Last night while I was cleaning data in R, I encountered such a weird behavior of <code>unique()</code> function that I once suspected that there had been something wrong with the newly updated R 3.4.3. The following is a reproducible example of my problem.</p>
<p>I read in a vector variable <code>x</code> from csv file, and printed it on R console.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;non-breaking space&quot; &quot;non-breaking space&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Apparently, <code>x</code> contained two “identtical” elements and it should have only one unique value. However,</p>
<pre class="r"><code>unique(x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;non-breaking space&quot; &quot;non-breaking space&quot;</code></pre>
<p>returned two unique values that are visually the same. It was so weird. According to my experience of data clean in R, I suspected the problem may occur in the space. I tried <code>Space</code> and <code>Tab</code>(displayed as <code>\t</code> on R console, which can be easily distinguished from <code>Space</code>) that were usually encountered during data clean. Unfortunately, the problem was not resolved. I worked on this problem up to 3AM and tried the possibilities that I could think of, including uninstalling the newly updated R 3.4.3 and running above code with an old version of R. After hours of trials and errors, I got a feeling that the problem was relevant to the encoding of the space. Finally I copied the raw data into <a href="http://asciivalue.com/">ASCII Value Tool</a> to show the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> value of the space. The ASCII value of <code>x[1]</code> is 32 in Decimal value, which is the common ordinary space. On the contrary, <code>x[2]</code> has the ASCII value of 160 in Decimal value, which corresponds to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space">non-breaking space</a>. In HTML, non-breaking space is common (but this was my first time to encounter non-breaking space while cleaning data in R) and is encoded as <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> or <code>&amp;#160;</code>. In Unicode, it is encoded as <code>U+00A0</code>. In UTF-8, it is encoded as <code>C2 A0</code>.</p>
<p>I used following R code to confirm that there was non-breaking space in <code>x[2]</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tools::showNonASCII(x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 2: non-breaking&lt;c2&gt;&lt;a0&gt;space</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>stringi::stri_enc_mark(x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;ASCII&quot; &quot;UTF-8&quot;</code></pre>
<p><code>showNonASCII()</code> picked out non-ASCII character contained in <code>x[2]</code> and printed it as <code>&lt;c2&gt;&lt;a0&gt;</code>. <code>stri_enc_mark</code> showed the encodings for <code>x[1]</code> and <code>x[2]</code> were ASCII and UTF-8.</p>
<p>After knowing the space in <code>x[2]</code> was non-breaking space, I fixed the problem by substituting the non-breaking space with the ordinary space. Now <code>unique(x)</code> returns only one unique value.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>y &lt;- gsub(&quot;\u00A0&quot;, &quot; &quot;, x, fixed = TRUE)
unique(y)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;non-breaking space&quot;</code></pre>
<p><br>
In most cases, non-breaking space is displayed as the ordinary space character that we cannot visually tell. Therefore, I installed the <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Unicode%20Character%20Highlighter">Unicode Character Highlighter</a> plugin for my commonly used Sublime Text editor. Now my Sublime Text can highlight non-breaking space and I can visually detect it.</p>
<p>At last I ends the post with a <a href="https://ridzalzainal.deviantart.com/art/EVA-Unit-01-Non-Breaking-Space-Geek-Joke-403011701">non-breaking space geek joke</a> created by Ridzal Zainal. Could you get the point?</p>
