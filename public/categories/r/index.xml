      <description>Update on 2018-07-05
From the discussion with Yihui Xie, if Ghostscript was installed via brew, Homebrew should automatically make symlinks to /usr/local/bin/gs which is already under the PATH. Hence there is no need to set PATH variable for gs. However, the following approach is useful for other commands that are not under the PATH.
These days I am using ImageMagick to convert multiple pdfs (or pngs) into an animation gif to demonstrate the algorithm that I proposed for estimating epidemic onset.</description>

      <description>Last night while I was cleaning data in R, I encountered such a weird behavior of unique() function that I once suspected that there had been something wrong with the newly updated R 3.4.3. The following is a reproducible example of my problem.
I read in a vector variable x from csv file, and printed it on R console.
x ## [1] &amp;#34;non-breaking space&amp;#34; &amp;#34;non-breakingÂ space&amp;#34; Apparently, x contained two &amp;ldquo;identtical&amp;rdquo; elements and it should have only one unique value.</description>

      <description>The 10th China R Conference was held in Tsinghua University during May 19 - 21. I initialized the session of R in Public Health. Though it was my first time to organize a session, to invite speakers, and to host it, the session was successful. The number of audiences was more than 55 persons and beyond my expectation, and the discussions were enthusiastic. I believe that via my talk more Chinese have known the R Epidemics Consortium (RECON) and they may try to use RECON packages to facilitate their epidemics research.</description>

      <description>Problem The easy test for becoming a potential student of animint project for GSoC 2015 is to use animint to visualize some data from your domain of expertise, and upload your visualization to the web using animint2gist. I used animint to visualize the data from the CDC&amp;rsquo;s State-level FluView, which is a main data source of my Ph.D. influenza research. The script for generating the FluView viz can be found in AnimintTest repository.</description>

      <description>In routine data analysis, I often need to convert list elements into variables. For exampple, when I create a function returning multiple values and I would like to use those values as variables separately, as only one object can be returned by the function, the common way to accomplish this task is that multiple values are combined as a list returned by the function, elements of interest are then extracted and assigned to variables.</description>

      <title>Stratified Importance Sampling</title>

      <description>The following R codes implement the Example 5.13 in Statistical Computing with R, and compare the estimate \(\hat{\theta}\) and \(\hat{\sigma}\) from stratified importance sampling to the results from importance sampling. The example illustrates that stratification can reduce the varinace of importance sampling estimator.
M &amp;lt;- 100000 # number of replicates g &amp;lt;- function(x) { exp(-x - log(1 + x^2)) * (x &amp;gt; 0) * (x &amp;lt; 1) } # importance sampling u &amp;lt;- runif(M) # f3, inverse transform method x &amp;lt;- -log(1 - u * (1 - exp(-1))) fg &amp;lt;- g(x) / (exp(-x) / (1 - exp(-1))) (theta.</description>
