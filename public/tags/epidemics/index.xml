      <description>The 10th China R Conference was held in Tsinghua University during May 19 - 21. I initialized the session of R in Public Health. Though it was my first time to organize a session, to invite speakers, and to host it, the session was successful. The number of audiences was more than 55 persons and beyond my expectation, and the discussions were enthusiastic. I believe that via my talk more Chinese have know the R Epidemics Consortium (RECON) and they may try to use RECON packages to facilitate their epidemics research.</description>
